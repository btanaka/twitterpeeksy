twitterpeeksy is a simple Ruby script that shows the most recent Twitter
tweets in the console/shell. 

It's not a thing of beauty. I tossed it together for personal use, but
perhaps one day it'll be less fugly. In the meanwhile, you're welcome to use
it if you like.


Usage
=====

% twitterpeeksy.rb


INSTALLATION
============

twitterpeeksy requires a ~/.twitterpeeksy config file. In it, place the
following lines:

user: btanaka
password: [password goes here]
source: http://twitter.com/statuses/friends_timeline/806210.rss

Replace the source URI with your timeline's URI. Order matters, at
the moment.
